# The issue

Patient apps (eg Apple Health) get data from FHIR end points. Periodically they ask for new / changed data - 
relying on Meta.lastUpdated or searching by _lastUpdated.

If the patient record within the provider is the result of a merge and that gets undone - or if a new merge happen - 
the data will change in a way that the system above would not detect: a bunch of old data points disappear (split) or appear (merge). 
The data in the app will be out of sync - and in the case of a split in a very bad way: data of what is now known to the provider to be 
a _different_ patient is in still in the personal data of a different person inside the app.
